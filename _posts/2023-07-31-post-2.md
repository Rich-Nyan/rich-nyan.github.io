# Overview

Over the past two months, I have been researching in game theory with Fernando under the UT CLeAR Lab. Currently, we are coding an optimizer to generate a trajectory for each player in a collision-avoidance differential game. In addition, in order to verify the trajectories, I coded up a plotting tool in Julia that will work for any number of players.

For an introductory to collision avoidance, [here](../post-3) is an optimization problem that I completed that generates optimal trajectory planning but absent of any inequality constraints.

# Problem Statement
## Example
![img-description](../../images/hyperplane_2p.gif)
_The trajectory above is the expected behavior of two players given the problem conditions. The optimizer returns constraints on Player $1$. Specifically, the plot shows that Player $1$ must be at least $0.3$ units from Player $2$ at all time and it must never cross the hyperplane. In the trajectory, we see that Player $1$ decelerates, which demonstrates the minimal cost or controls needed to satisfy the problem statement._

## General
The objective of this optimizer is as follows.

$$\min_{x^i,u^i} J^i(\textbf{x},\textbf{u},\theta)$$

$$\textnormal{subject to } H^i(\textbf{x},\textbf{u},\theta) \ge 0$$

$$\hspace{21 mm} G^i(\textbf{x},\textbf{u},\theta) = 0$$

<b>State</b>
</blockquote>

Given $N$ players and $T$ timesteps, for each $i \in$ {$1,2,\dots, n$} and $t \in ${$1,2,\dots, T$}


$$\textbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix}\textbf{x}_1 \\ \vdots \\ \textbf{x}_T \end{bmatrix}$$


$$\textbf{x}_t = \begin{bmatrix}\textbf{x}_t^1 \\ \vdots \\ \textbf{x}_t^N \end{bmatrix}$$

$$\textbf{x}_t^i = \begin{bmatrix} x_t^i & y_t^i & \dot{x}_t^i & \dot{y}_t^i \end{bmatrix}^\intercal$$

Note that $\dot{x}$ denotes velocity in the $x$-direction, and similar for $\dot{y}$.

<b>Controls</b>
</blockquote>

$$\textbf{u} = \begin{bmatrix}\textbf{u}_1 \\ \vdots \\ \textbf{u}_T \end{bmatrix}$$

$$\textbf{u}_t = \begin{bmatrix}\textbf{u}_t^1 \\ \vdots \\ \textbf{u}_t^N \end{bmatrix}$$

$$\textbf{x}_t^i = \begin{bmatrix} \ddot{x}_t^i & \ddot{y}_t^i \end{bmatrix}^\intercal$$

$\ddot{x}$ denotes acceleration in $x$-direction and $\ddot{y}$ denotes acceleration in $y$-direction.

<b>Unknown Parameters</b>
</blockquote>

$$ \theta^i = \begin{bmatrix}\omega^i \\ \alpha^i \\ \rho^i \\ q^i \\ r^i \end{bmatrix}$$

where $\omega$ is rotation rate of hyperplane, $\alpha$ is the hyperplane initial orientation, and $\rho$ being the Keep-out-Zone radius. $q$ and $r$ are the weights in the cost function.

$G(\textbf{x},\textbf{u},\theta)$ is the equality constraint. It is utilized for each player to make sure dynamics are being followed.

$F(\textbf{x},\textbf{u},\theta)$ is the inequality constraint. In this case, it is used to make sure that for any two players, the constraints placed on one of the two is never broken.

<b>Plot Setup</b>
</blockquote>
```julia
    players = floor(Int,length(mat)/4)
    colors = palette(:default)[1:players] # Players can be max at 16
    # Boundaries
    x_domain = extrema(mati[:,1,:]) .+ (-0.01, 0.01)
    y_domain = extrema(mati[:,2,:]) .+ (-0.01, 0.01)
    domain  = [minimum([x_domain[1],y_domain[1]]),maximum([x_domain[2],y_domain[2]])]
```
mat is the a $2$-D vector returned from the optimizer. Each player contains $4$ lines and each line returns the current state for that player at that timestamp. 

I converted mat to mati, a $3$-D vector. The first dimension is the player, the second dimension indicates which index for the state vector, and the third dimension indicates the timestep.

```julia
for j in 1:players
    plot!(
            [mati[j,1,k] for k in 1:1:i],
            [mati[j,2,k] for k in 1:1:i],
            j,
            linewidth = 1,
            linecolor = colors[j],
            label = false
         )
end
```
At each timestep, it loops up to the current timestep in the gif, and plots each point using the $x$ and $y$ values.

```julia
for j in 1:numofconstraints
    constrain = indexvalues[j][1]
    center = indexvalues[j][2]
    c = x -> (mati[center,1,i] .+ ρs[constrain, center] .* cos.(x), mati[center,2,i] .+ ρs[constrain, center] .* sin.(x)) 
    
    plot!(
        [c(t) for t = range(0, stop=2pi, length=100)],
        linewidth = 1,
        linecolor = colors[constrain],
        seriesalpha = 1,
        # fill = true,
        # fillalpha = 0.1,
        label = false
    )
end
```
Using the unknown parameters returned from the optimizer, we can generate an equation for the line by looping through the $x$-coordinate domain and getting the $y$-yalue associated with that point.

<b>Circle</b>
</blockquote> 
```julia
for j in 1:numofconstraints
    constrain = indexvalues[j][1]
    center = indexvalues[j][2]
    c = x -> (mati[center,1,i] .+ ρs[constrain, center] .* cos.(x), mati[center,2,i] .+ ρs[constrain, center] .* sin.(x)) 
    
    plot!(
        [c(t) for t = range(0, stop=2pi, length=100)],
        linewidth = 1,
        linecolor = colors[constrain],
        seriesalpha = 1,
        # fill = true,
        # fillalpha = 0.1,
        label = false
    )
end
```
We can generate an equation for the circle again by looping from $0$ to $2\pi$ radians and returning the coordinate on the circle in that direction.

```julia

    constrain = indexvalues[j][1]
    center = indexvalues[j][2]
    u = [ρs[constrain, center] * cos(αs[constrain, center] + ωs[constrain, center] * i)]
    v = [ρs[constrain, center] * sin(αs[constrain, center] + ωs[constrain, center] * i)]
    quiver!([mati[center,1,i]], [mati[center,2,i]], quiver =(u, v), arrow = true, arrowhead_length = 0.05, arrowhead_width = 0.03, linecolor = colors[constrain], linewidth = 2)
end
```
Utilizes Julia's quiver in plots to plot the normal vector to the hyperplane from the center of the KoZ.
