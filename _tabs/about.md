Welcome! My name is Ryan Chin and I am a college freshman at MIT.

I am interested in math, artificial intelligence, and finance. Currently, I am a student researcher at [MIT CSAIL Clinical Decision Making Group](https://mit-medg.github.io/) working in conjunction with [Ita√∫ Unibanco](https://www.itau.com.br/) to address class imbalance in transactional datasets for more accurate fraud detection.

In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano, cooking for myself, and competing as a member of MIT's varsity fencing team.
