Welcome! My name is Ryan Chin and I am a rising high school senior in Austin, Texas. 

I am interested in math, computer science, and finance. Currently, I am a student researcher under the mentorship of Fernando Palafox Escobedo at the [UT Austin CLeAR Lab](https://clearoboticslab.github.io).

In my free time, I am a competitive fencer and a tutor for [Math Done Right](https://sites.google.com/view/math-done-right/home).
